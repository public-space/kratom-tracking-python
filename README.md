Certainly, partner! Let's outline the steps for iteration 0 and update the project sheet. We'll follow a class-based approach for the choice menu and user interaction, allowing for easy extension and modularity. Additionally, we'll provide a file structure overview and explain the SQL commands used. Here's the updated plan:

## Project Plan: Iteration 0 - Kratom Tracking App

### Step 1: Set Up SQL Database and User Table

1. Create a new SQL database file to store user data.
2. Define a common user table structure with the following fields:
   - `id` (integer): Unique identifier for each user.
   - `email` (text): User's email address for registration and login.
   - `password` (text): User's password for authentication.

### Step 2: Implement Class-Based Choice Menu and User Interaction

1. Create a `Menu` class to handle the choice menu and user interaction.
2. Implement a `display_menu()` method to print the available menu options.
3. Implement a `process_menu_choice()` method to handle user input and execute corresponding actions.
4. Extend the `Menu` class to create specific menus for different functionalities (e.g., "Log Dose Menu," "View Dose Info Menu").

### Step 3: Implement Basic SQL Operations Class

1. Create a `SQLHandler` class to handle basic SQL operations.
2. Implement a `create_user_table()` method to create the user table in the database.
3. Implement a `register_user()` method to add a new user to the table.
4. Implement a `login_user()` method to authenticate a user's login.
5. Implement a `view_user_data()` method to retrieve user information from the table.

### Step 4: Implement "Log Dose" Functionality

1. Extend the `Menu` class to create a "Log Dose Menu" class.
2. Implement a `log_dose()` method to capture and store dose information in the table.
3. Use the timestamp data type to automatically record the current time for each dose.

### Step 5: Implement "View Dose Info" Functionality

1. Extend the `Menu` class to create a "View Dose Info Menu" class.
2. Implement a `view_dose_data()` method to retrieve and display dose information from the table.

### Step 6: Implement Additional Functionality (Future Iterations)

1. Extend the appropriate menu classes to implement additional functionalities, such as analytics, data manipulation, and user profile management.
2. Integrate appropriate SQL operations in the `SQLHandler` class to support these functionalities.

## File Structure Overview

Here's an overview of the file structure for the Kratom Tracking App project:

```
- kratom_tracking_app/
  - app.py                   # Main entry point for the application
  - database/
    - kratom.db              # SQLite database file
  - functions/
    - __init__.py            # Empty file to make the folder a package
    - menu.py                # Class-based choice menu and user interaction
    - sql_handler.py         # Class for basic SQL operations
  - iterations/
    - iteration_0/
      - __init__.py          # Empty file to make the folder a package
      - create_database.py    # Script to create the SQL database and user table
  - README.md                # Project documentation and instructions
```

### Explanation of SQL Commands

Here are the SQL commands used in the project:

- `CREATE TABLE`: This command creates a new table in the database with specified column names and data types.
- `INSERT INTO`: This command inserts new rows of data into a table, specifying the column names and corresponding values.
- `SELECT`: This command retrieves data from the table based on specified conditions.
- `UPDATE`: This command modifies existing data in the table based on specified conditions.
- `DELETE FROM`: This command removes rows of data from the table based on specified conditions.

In the project, we'll use these commands to create the user table, insert user data, retrieve user data, and perform other SQL operations as needed.

Let's begin implementing iteration 0 with the new approach. Feel free to ask any questions or seek further clarification as we progress!
